# RadioU Stream Helpers

This is a community-maintained JavaScript library that provides functionality for streaming of RadioU and The Worst of the Riot.
## Why build this library?

I am the maintainer of the RadioU Alexa skill.  I am also working on porting streaming functionality to the Google Home and potentially rewriting the RadioU app in React Native.  All of these platforms use JS, so I wrote a library that would assist in writing those projects.
